            This React application is designed for an online shopping
            experience, with a focus on browsing products, managing a shopping
            cart, and completing purchases. App Component: Manages the layout
            and routing of the application, using ShoppingCartProvider to share
            cart data and Router for navigation. It sets up routes for viewing
            products, the shopping cart, product details, and the checkout page.
            ProductList Component: Displays a list of products fetched from an
            API. Users can click on a product to view its details. ProductDetail
            Component: Shows detailed information about a specific product and
            allows users to add it to their cart. ShoppingCart Component:
            Provides an overview of the items in the cart, calculates costs, and
            allows users to proceed to checkout. Checkout Component: Facilitates
            the finalization of the purchase by collecting billing information
            and confirming the order. Together, these components create a
            cohesive shopping experience, from product discovery to purchase
            completion.
