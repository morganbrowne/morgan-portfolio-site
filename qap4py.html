            This Python script, is designed to generate detailed insurance
            invoices for One Stop Insurance. The script streamlines the
            invoicing process by validating customer information, calculating
            costs, and producing a formatted invoice.
            <br />
            Key Features:
            <br />
            <br />

            1. Input Validation: Ensures customer details, including names,
            addresses, postal codes, and phone numbers, are correctly formatted.
            <br />
            <br />

            2. Cost Calculation: Computes total insurance costs based on base
            premiums, number of cars, and additional coverage options. It also
            calculates applicable HST.
            <br />
            <br />

            3. Payment Options: Handles various payment methods (full, monthly,
            down payment) and adjusts calculations accordingly. Previous Claims:
            Allows entry and display of previous claims, adding valuable context
            to the invoice.
            <br />
            <br />

            4. Invoice Output: Produces a clear and comprehensive invoice with
            all relevant details, including customer information, policy
            specifics, and payment breakdown.
            <br />
            <br />

            5. The script reads and updates default values from a file
            (Defualt.dat), ensuring that each new invoice reflects accurate and
            current policy information.
